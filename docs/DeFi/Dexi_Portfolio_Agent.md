## Creating and Managing a Portfolio Agent on Dexi

### Connecting Your Wallet & Navigating the Interface

First, connect your crypto wallet to Dexi. Once connected, navigate to the **My Portfolio** page. Here, you have a comprehensive overview of your portfolio:

- **Asset Overview**: Displays your held assets and their values.
- **Liquidity Pools (LPs)**: Lists active pools you're participating in.
- **Running Agents**: Shows all currently active autonomous agents you've spawned.
- **Transaction History**: Records all your past transactions.
- Other financial instruments on the AO network

Consider this your command center‚Äîa centralized dashboard providing full visibility and control over your interactions within the AO ecosystem.

### Spawning a Portfolio Agent

From the **My Portfolio** page, click on the clearly indicated **"Spawn Portfolio Agent"** button. This action will open a modal window allowing you to configure your new Portfolio Agent comprehensively.

#### Configuring Your Portfolio Agent

When the configuration modal opens, you will be asked for several key inputs:

- **Agent Name**: Give your agent a unique, easily identifiable name.
- **Quote Token**: Currently, AO is the default quote token used to value your portfolio. You can also use AR or other Assets as the Quote assets.
- **Portfolio Tokens**: Select at least two tokens to include in your agent's portfolio.

Once tokens are selected, Dexi automatically populates the available tokens list, clearly displaying:

- **Token Name**
- **Current Price**
- **Available Liquidity**

Initially, your portfolio allocation will be evenly distributed across selected tokens. Adjust individual allocations by changing percentages, instantly reflected visually in an interactive pie chart.

As you modify the token percentages:

- The pie chart dynamically updates, clearly illustrating your portfolio's composition.
- Each token's allocation can be precisely adjusted, providing granular control over your asset exposure.

#### Deviation Percentage Explained

The **Deviation Percentage** allows the Portfolio Agent to determine permissible fluctuations away from the target asset allocations during active management.

For example:

- A **10% deviation** means:

  - A portfolio with **4 assets** allows each asset to deviate by approximately **¬±2.5%**.
  - A portfolio with **10 assets** means each asset deviates roughly **¬±1%**.

This flexible mechanism helps minimize unnecessary trading costs while maintaining portfolio balance efficiently.

#### Slippage Tolerance

**Slippage Tolerance** defines the maximum acceptable price impact when your agent swaps tokens. This feature ensures your agent executes trades efficiently, balancing speed and cost-effectiveness.

- Dexi primarily supports Uniswap V2-type pools, meaning some price impact is inevitable.
- A **minimum of 5% slippage tolerance** is recommended, accommodating lower-liquidity pools effectively.
- When enabled, the agent always seeks the lowest possible price impact, ensuring optimal execution conditions for your portfolio.

#### Funding & Spawning Your Agent

After configuring your asset selections, deviation, slippage tolerance, and reviewing your portfolio allocation:

1.  Enter the total **Investment Amount** in AO Tokens.
2.  Click **"Create"** to spawn your Portfolio Agent.

Upon creation, your funds are deployed, and the Portfolio Agent becomes an autonomous, active process within the AO ecosystem.

### Managing Your Portfolio Agent

After deployment, Dexi provides intuitive controls to actively manage your Portfolio Agent directly through the user-friendly agent interface.

#### Top-up, Pause, and Withdraw Actions

Once your Portfolio Agent is active, you'll have convenient controls at your fingertips:

- **üîº Top-up**

  - Allows you to add additional funds to an already running agent. Useful for scaling successful strategies or reacting proactively to market conditions.

- **‚è∏Ô∏è Pause**

  - Temporarily pauses your agent‚Äôs autonomous actions, halting all rebalancing and asset management activities. Ideal during volatile or uncertain market periods, letting you manually review conditions or strategies before resuming operations.

- **üîΩ Withdraw**

  - Initiates the termination of your Portfolio Agent, prompting the withdrawal of all managed funds. A detailed summary screen appears, clearly displaying assets to withdraw, deposit history, and the agent‚Äôs lifetime performance metrics (PnL, duration, rebalance frequency).

#### Agent Withdrawal Summary

When withdrawing, Dexi provides a comprehensive summary:

- **Assets to Withdraw**: Clearly lists tokens and their current value.
- **Deposit History**: Displays the total funds you've deposited into the agent.
- **Performance Overview**: Summarizes the agent‚Äôs lifespan, number of rebalances, total deposited funds, and overall profit or loss, giving complete transparency on its effectiveness.
