## What is USDA?

USDA is an AO-native stablecoin designed to solve liquidity fragmentation across blockchain ecosystems. It functions as a universal conversion layer that aggregates multiple stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) and fiat currencies into a single unified asset on AO.

### Core Functions

USDA serves as:

- A stable value layer for both human users and autonomous agents within AO
- The foundational infrastructure enabling seamless transitions between traditional finance and on-chain applications
- A unified accounting unit for smart contracts and DeFi primitives on AO

### Technical Framework

The Astro Protocol powers USDA by creating a bridge between traditional financial infrastructure and decentralized systems. Key aspects include:

- Leveraging AO's hyper-parallel computing environment
- Utilizing transparent smart contracts for security and auditability
- Supporting deep liquidity pools that align with AO's parallel processing capabilities

### Strategic Purpose

USDA addresses several ecosystem challenges:

- Eliminates liquidity fragmentation that affects borrowing rates and DEX efficiency
- Creates a stable value foundation for autonomous systems to interact financially
- Supports AO's unique architecture which requires predictable value exchange for both human and machine interactions
