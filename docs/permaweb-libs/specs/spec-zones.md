# Zones

**Status:** Draft

**Version:** 0.0.1

**Authors:** Nick Juliano (nick@arweave.org)

## Introduction

This document defines the concept of **Zones** on Arweave / AO. A Zone is a modular, programmable representation of an **entity** within the ecosystem. These entities could be but are not limited to user profiles, organizations, channels, and more. Zones serve as a container for storing and managing information relevant to the entity, and as a medium for executing actions on its behalf.

## Motivation

**Zones** address several challenges and unmet needs within Arweave / AO. As the ecosystem grows and diversifies, the need for a standardized approach toward storing entity-specific data and executing their actions becomes more apparent.

## Specification

An AO process can be identified as a **Zone** by including the following tags and data structures which meet a specific [**Data-Protocol**](https://arweave.net/F63wJCavB_sN2xxW-qtQ1Vv7_eRgmYCdcoQPMp_-N0w)

#### Zone Data-Protocol

The transaction tags and relevant data structures that make up the **Zone Data-Protocol** are as follows:

**Transaction Tags**

| **Tag Name**  | **Required** | **Tag Value**                                |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Data-Protocol | True         | Zone                                         |
| Zone-Type     | True         | (Not limited to) User, Organization, Channel |
| Variant       | False        | (Label describing the variant)               |

**Data Structures**

**Store**: This table in the AO Process holds the data relevant to the Zone, which could look something like **{ Title: MyTitle, Description: MyDescription }**

**Assets**: This table holds up to date information regarding the tokens / assets on AO that this zone has created or received.

## Conclusion

Zones provide a foundational framework for creating programmable, and interoperable entities within the AO / Arweave ecosystem, empowering developers and users to build and interact with decentralized applications.
