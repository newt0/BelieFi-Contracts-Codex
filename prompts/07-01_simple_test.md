Based on the Phase 6 deliverables, implement simple operational verification (MVP simplified version).

Requirements:

- Basic operational verification only
- Manual test scenarios
- Minimum verification
- Debug output

Implementation Details:

1. Basic operational verification functions
2. Test helper functions
3. Debug output functionality

Test Scenarios (Manual Execution):

### Basic Function Tests

1. testBasicInfo(): Process information verification

   - Verify Info Handler operation
   - Output basic information

2. testMintFlow(): Mint flow verification

   - Execute Mint with test address
   - Verify results

3. testLimitations(): Restriction function verification
   - 1 address 1 NFT limitation
   - 100 NFT upper limit verification

### Debug Functions

1. debugState(): Output current State
2. debugMintStatus(): Output Mint status
3. resetForTesting(): Test reset (development environment only)

Execution Method:

```lua
-- Test execution example
testBasicInfo()
testMintFlow("test_address_123")
debugState()
```

MVP Simplification Points:

- No automatic test framework
- No complex assertions
- Minimum mock data
- No CI/CD integration

Notes:

- Disable test functions in production environment
- Manual operational verification is prerequisite
- Basic operation guarantee only

Please integrate with the previous code and implement complete code including simple operational verification functionality.
