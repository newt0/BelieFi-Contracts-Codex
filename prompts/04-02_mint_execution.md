Based on the Phase 4-1 deliverables, implement Mint execution functionality.

Requirements:

- Implementation of complete Mint process
- NFT creation and ID management
- Atomic Assets compliant Mint processing
- Complete processing flow upon successful Mint

Implementation Details:

1. NFT ID generation and management system
2. Atomic Assets Mint processing
3. Ownership setting and management
4. Integrated processing flow upon successful Mint

Technical Specifications:

- NFT ID format: Sequential numbers (1-100)
- Ownership: Address of Mint executor
- Total supply: Fixed at 100 pieces
- Mint status: "active" | "sold_out"

NFT Basic Information:

- Name: "AO MAXI"
- Symbol: "AOMAXI"
- Denomination: "1"
- Total Supply: "100"

Integrated Mint Processing Flow (MVP Simplified Version):

1. Pre-validation (limits, inventory)
2. Lucky Number generation
3. Market Sentiment generation
4. NFT metadata creation
5. Atomic Assets Mint execution
6. Ownership setting
7. Revenue recording
8. Success notification

Data Structures:

- nft_owners: NFT ID → Owner Address
- nft_balances: Address → Balance
- mint_history: Mint history records
- current_supply: Current issued count

Functional Requirements:

1. executeFullMint(buyer_address, payment_amount): Complete Mint execution (Public Mint)
2. generateNFTId(): Generate next NFT ID
3. mintAtomicAsset(nft_id, owner, metadata): Atomic Assets Mint
4. setOwnership(nft_id, owner): Set ownership
5. updateSupply(): Update issued count
6. recordMintSuccess(nft_id, owner, timestamp): Record success

Atomic Assets Compliance Requirements:

- Balance management: NFT holdings per address
- Transfer functionality: NFT transfer processing (limited for future SBT conversion)
- Info functionality: NFT information retrieval
- Metadata integration

Error Handling:

- ID generation failure: "NFT ID generation failed"
- Mint processing failure: "NFT minting failed"
- Ownership setting failure: "Ownership assignment failed"
- Supply exceeded: "Maximum supply reached"

Rollback Processing:

- State restoration upon Mint failure
- Maintain consistency upon partial success
- Detailed error logging

MVP Simplification:

- No Allow List check
- No Smart Wallet creation
- Funds managed within process

Please integrate with the previous code and implement complete code including full Mint execution functionality.
